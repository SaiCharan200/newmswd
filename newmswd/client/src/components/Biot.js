       <h1>BioTech Department</h1>
       <h4>Hod:Dr. Giridhar Kanuri</h4>
       <p>The strength of the department is the faculty drawn from reputed national and international academic & 
        research organizations. The faculty has more than 15 years of teaching experience with good industrial
         exposure. Faculty with postdoctoral research experience is feathers in the cap of the department. The 
         faculty are extensively involved in quality research & development and in the last 3 years has acquired 
         projects worth more than 3 crores rupees in the areas of biofuels, biomedical research, genomics and
          proteomics, bioinformatics and food biotechnology funded by prestigious research organizations like DBT, 
          DST, UGC and ICMR. The department also has women scientists working under DST funded projects. 
          The Department has filed patents with IPO in collaboration with industry. The biotechnology department 
          at KL University has 7 well-furnished and fully equipped state-of-the-art laboratories, 4 research centers
           along with own computer center with latest molecular modeling and drug design software purchased from 
           Schrodinger LLC, USA. As a part of student centric learning development various measures and initiatives
            are taken to improve the skills of students. These include exposure to guest lectures, industrial 
            training and tours, communication and soft skills, mini-projects, paper presentations in national level
             paper contests, classroom seminars, placement opportunities, academic & career counseling,
              certificate courses, live projects in industry and exposure to journals etc. Another area of 
              concentration for the faculty is research consultancy. The department has signed MoUs with Sneha Biotech,
               Vijayawada and NRI Academy of Medical Sciences, Guntur for faculty and student training and 
               collaborative research. The department of biotechnology is also in collaboration with the Indian
                Institute of Science, Bengaluru and University of Oxford, UK for initiating collaborative research 
                in biomedical sciences.</p>
